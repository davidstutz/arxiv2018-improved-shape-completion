We address the problem of 3D shape completion from sparse and noisy point clouds, a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recent approaches are either data-driven or learning-based: Data-driven approaches rely on a shape model whose parameters are optimized to fit the observations; Learning-based approaches, in contrast, avoid the expensive optimization step by learning to directly predict complete shapes from incomplete observations in a fully-supervised setting. However, full supervision is often not available in practice. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised learning-based approach to 3D shape completion which neither requires slow optimization nor direct supervision. While we also learn a shape prior on synthetic data, we amortize, \ie, \emph{learn}, maximum likelihood fitting using deep neural networks resulting in efficient shape completion without sacrificing accuracy. On synthetic benchmarks based on ShapeNet \citep{Chang2015ARXIV} and ModelNet \citep{Wu2015CVPR} as well as on real robotics data from KITTI  \citep{Geiger2012CVPR} and \Kinect \citep{Yang2018ARXIVb}, we demonstrate that the proposed amortized maximum likelihood approach is able to compete with the fully supervised baseline of \cite{Dai2017CVPRa} and outperforms the data-driven approach of \cite{Engelmann2016GCPR}, while requiring less supervision and being significantly faster.
